## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Love native Android development and a bit Flutter. </br>
Love very difficult and useful tasks. </br>
Won some Telegram android contests. </br> </br>
Dont love big teams and overengeneering or overarchitecturing because of overhyped unnecessity (conformism) and unreasonable increase in development time (and price), usually entailing a decrease in the quality of the software itself. Using of the word "legacy" is an attempt to justify one's incompetence as a developer. </br> </br>
Currently working on some pet projects on Flutter and [Telegram for Android wearable lite](https://t.me/+V3MQjx9dfCEwMjJi) (without using TDlib, Java only) </br> </br>
Some projects I've participated in: 
  [Timebook ios](https://apps.apple.com/ru/app/timebook/id1561578302), [Flowwow android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.flowwow), [LS.NET android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.lsboutqiue.app), [Swip android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.it.swip), [P&G Calendar android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.pg.periodcalendar_40817_1617_cmg_0076) and some automotive things for PSA and FCA which cannot be referenced </br> </br>
