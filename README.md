### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Working on some pet projects on Flutter and [Telegram for Android wearable lite](https://t.me/+V3MQjx9dfCEwMjJi) (without using TDlib, Java only) </br> </br>
Hate overengeneering and big teams (please f*** off with those overhyped unnecessary abstractions, software firstly should work properly, fast, lightweight, consistent and crash free, too much attention to architecture will never help you to be better than competitors in the market)</br> </br>
Some projects I've participated in: 
  [Timebook ios](https://apps.apple.com/ru/app/timebook/id1561578302), [Flowwow android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.flowwow), [LS.NET android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.lsboutqiue.app), [Swip android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.it.swip), [P&G Calendar android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.pg.periodcalendar_40817_1617_cmg_0076) and some automotive things for PSA and FCA which cannot be referenced </br> </br>
